"""Loading and filtering shapes.csv.

Shared by roofline.py, matrix.py and tune.py so that `--hkv 8` selects the same
rows whichever tool is asked. Selecting by hand instead -- editing the csv, or
passing a model substring that happens to cover the shapes you meant -- is how
a pass ends up measuring a different set than the one it reports.

    """The floor for one decode-attention call, in microseconds.

    Deliberately algorithmic. It counts what the problem requires -- one kernel
    dispatch, the query in, the KV cache in, the output out, and the block
    table that addresses the pages -- and nothing an implementation chose. Our
    own split-KV partials go through global memory and can exceed the KV
    traffic at short context, but they are excluded on purpose: a denominator
    that grew with a kernel's own overhead would let a wasteful kernel report
    itself near the roof. One dispatch is counted rather than NSEG of them, for
    the same reason -- the decomposition is ours, the single launch is not.

    The dispatch term dominates at short context: at S=128 it is more than the
    bytes for every shape in the table, which is why %roof there used to read
    absurdly low. So this is a floor for any implementation, not a model of
    ours.

        hq: Query heads.
        hkv: KV heads.
        d: Head dimension.
        m: Query tokens per sequence.
        s: Context length.
        itemsize: Bytes per element of Q, K, V and the output.
        block_size: KV cache page size, for the block table.
        window: Sliding window in keys, 0 for full attention.  A windowed layer
            needs only the keys some query can see: min(s, window + m - 1).
