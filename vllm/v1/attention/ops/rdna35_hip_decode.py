"""Loader for the RDNA3.5 paged decode-attention kernel.

The kernel in ``csrc/rocm/rdna35_decode_attn.cu`` takes its shapes as
compile-time defines, so one build serves exactly one shape tuple.  The
variants the backend's tables name are compiled with the rest of vLLM into
``_rocm_C`` (the list is ``csrc/rocm/rdna35_attn/variants.def``, written by
``write_variants_def``); any other variant is served by Triton.

The kernel tools (benchmarks/kernels/gfx1151_decode_attn) search variants
that are not in the list, so with ``VLLM_RDNA35_ATTN_JIT`` set every variant
is instead compiled here with ``torch.utils.cpp_extension.load``, from a
source checkout, in a few seconds rather than a vLLM rebuild.
